            Karen Miles is one of the most decorated sporting clays competitors in history. A three-time World Champion, she has dominated the women's division for over a decade with a combination of technical precision, mental toughness, and relentless preparation.

      <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Sporting Clays Academy was born from a simple observation: the gap between what world-class shooters know and what most students have access to is enormous. YouTube videos and occasional lessons only go so far. We wanted to build something comprehensive — a real training platform that could take a shooter from any level and give them a clear, structured path to improvement.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Karen and Gebben have spent their careers competing at the top of the sport and coaching students along the way. They have seen the breakthroughs that happen when a student finally understands proper technique, target reading, or the mental game. Sporting Clays Academy takes those same lessons and makes them available to anyone, anywhere, anytime.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
        Our mission is simple: deliver world-championship-caliber sporting clays instruction to every shooter who wants to get better. Whether you are chasing your first 50-straight or your next national title, the path starts here.
